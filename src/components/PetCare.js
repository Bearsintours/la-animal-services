                        <h3>Spay/Neuter is Required for Cats and Dogs in Los Angeles City</h3>

<p>On February 12, 2008, the City Council of Los Angeles gave final approval to a new law that requires all cats and dogs in the City to be spayed or neutered after the age of four months, with some specific exemptions allowed. The Mayor signed this ordinance on February 26, 2008, making Los Angeles the national leader in efforts to humanely decrease the number of pets abandoned and euthanized each year.</p>

<h3>Why Spay/Neuter is Good for Our City</h3>
<p>Spaying and Neutering are humane and life affirming means of ending euthanasia of healthy, adoptable pets. The new law will move Los Angeles towards being the most humane city in America by educating pet owners to be more responsible, making our streets safer, reducing the number of animals killed each year in our animal shelters, and allowing us to more effectively use our resources. The spay/neuter law will be a tool for Animal Services to hold accountable those pet owners whose irresponsibility threatens public safety and fills our animal shelters with unwanted dogs and cats.</p>

<h3>Key Facts About the New Spay/Neuter Law</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Effective since October 1, 2008</li>
    <li>Applies to all dogs and cats over four months of age, unless exempted (See “Exemptions” Link.)</li>
    <li>Violations are subject to three levels of increasing fines, starting at $100, to urge compliance</li>
    <li>Upon the second violation, animals are subject to mandatory sterilization</li>
    <li>After multiple violations, non-compliance is a misdemeanor</li>
    <li>Maintaining an intact dog requires both meeting the requirements for an exemption AND obtaining an intact license</li>
</ul>

<h4>See <a href="http://www.laanimalservices.com/general-information/spay-neuter/" target="_blank">Spay and Neuter Resources</a> for additional resource information</h4>

<h3>Why Spay/neuter is good for our pets</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Spaying and neutering are safe, simple surgeries that prevent animals from reproducing. Females are spayed; males are neutered</li>
    <li>One unneutered male can impregnate dozens of females. Therefore, it is just as important to neuter males as it is to spay females. Accidents happen when you least expect them</li>
    <li>Spaying and neutering reduces or eliminates the risk of certain types of cancer that can kill your pet or be expensive to treat</li>
    <li>Spaying and neutering may eliminate undesirable behaviors such as fighting, spraying, and roaming</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exemptions to the Spay/Neuter Requirement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Is a breed approved by and registered with a registry or association which, at a minimum, requires identification of the breed, date of birth, names of registered sire and dam, the name of breeder, and record-keeping relating to breeding, transfer of ownership and death, and does or will actively show or compete</li>
    <li>Has earned or is in the process of earning a special title (i.e. agility, herding)</li>
    <li>Is used as or in training to be a guide, signal, or service dog.
    Is a dog trained, or in training, for use in law enforcement, military or rescue activities</li>
    <li>Has a letter and documentation from a licensed veterinarian certifying that the animal should be temporarily or permanently deferred due to age or health</li>
    <li>Has a valid breeding permit issued to the owner pursuant to existing City ordinance</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, all intact dogs must have an intact dog license from the City.</p>

                    <div className="microchip">
                        <h1>Microchipping</h1>
<p>A microchip, the size of a grain of rice, is injected under the animal’s skin between the shoulder blades. Each chip has a unique number that is registered with a national database along with the pet owner’s address and phone number. The microchip can be read by scanners that are currently used by most animal organizations and veterinary clinics.Microchips keep people and pets together! Despite your best efforts, your dog or cat may slip out an open door or gate and disappear. We recommend a collar and identification tag but know that they often fall off. If you microchip your pet too -the odds are much better that you’ll get your best friend back!</p>
<p>All animals admitted to an L.A. Animal Services Shelter are scanned for a microchip. If a microchip is found, a nine digit number will appear and we will contact the microchip manufacturer. After a quick search of the pet database, the animal’s guardian can be contacted.</p>
<p>All cat, dogs and rabbits adopted from an L.A. Animal Services will have a microchip. The cost of microchipping is included in the adoption fee.</p>
<p>If you move, it is very important to change your address with the microchip company in case you pet gets lost.</p>
<p>Anyone can contact any of our L.A. Animal Services Shelters and schedule an appointment to have their companion animal microchipped. The cost for the general public is $25.00 per animal.</p>

                    <div className="vaccination">
                        <h1>Vaccination</h1>
<p>Regular veterinary care and vaccinations are important to keep your companion animals healthy.</p>
<p>You will want to visit veterinary offices and decide who your best friend’s doctor is going to be before he or she gets sick. Ask your friends who have pets for a recommendation. Look for an office that is clean and smells good, the receptionist and staff are welcoming. Make an appointment to see the entire clinic and to meet the veterinarian. If you are uncomfortable for any reason, find another veterinarian.</p>

                        <h1>Emergency Preparedness</h1>
<p>Have a rescue alert sticker(available at your local pet supply store) visible in one of your home’s windows that lists the number and species of animals residing in your home. If you evacuate with your animals during an emergency, and time allows, write “Evacuated” across the alert sticker.Make sure your pets are microchipped and have proper identification. This is the single most important step you can take to ensure that you and your companion animals will be reunited if you are separated. Don’t forget to include alternate contacts with the microchip registration, such as your cell phone number and phone numbers for an out-of-area relative so that you can still be contacted in the case of an evacuation.</p>
                        <h3>What to bring</h3>
<p>Keep a back-up a supply of pet food, prescription medications, kitty litter, and essentials. Also, assemble an animal evacuation kit with the following materials:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One durable animal carrier displaying your name, address, and phone number for each animal in your household</li>
    <li>Pet food (make sure that all canned meals have peel tops and use by date should be checked)</li>
    <li>Blankets</li>
    <li>Bottled water (5 gallons per animal is ideal)</li>
    <li>Leash, harness and collar</li>
    <li>Photocopies of medical and immunization records</li>
    <li>Recent photos of your pet (in case you need to create “lost” flyers or provide proof of ownership)</li>
    <li>Wet wipes</li>
    <li>Litter pan and cat litter</li>
    <li>Plastic bags</li>
</ul>

<p>Guidelines For Animal Guardians During A Natural Disaster
If you need to evacuate, TAKE YOUR ANIMALS WITH YOU. It is simply too dangerous to leave companion animals unattended during natural disasters. The best way to ensure the safety of your pets is to evacuate with them.</p>
<p>Locate pet-friendly lodgings. Contact establishments prior to an emergency to obtain their pet policy.</p>
<p>The following hotel chains accept pets at some or all of their locations (please note that restrictions and additional fees may apply):
America’s Best Value Inn, Best Western, Econo Lodge, Kimpton Group Hotels, La Quinta Inn & Suites, Marriott, Motel 6, Radisson, Red Roof Inn</p>

                        <h1>Planning for pets if you can't be there for them</h1>
<h3>Your illness, accident, hospitalization or death</h3>
<p>Companion animals may end up all alone with no one to care for them due to their owner’s unexpected illness, accident, hospitalization, or death when no arrangements have been made for their care.</p>

<p>By planning for the unexpected, you can ensure that your furry family member has food, water, shelter, proper care and love if you are no longer able to provide for them. Proper planning can help guarantee your best friend is well cared for in the event that something unexpected happens to you. Here is some information to get you started.</p>

<h3>Prepare for the unexpected</h3>
<p>Because pets need care daily and will need immediate attention should you become incapacitated, making informal arrangements for temporary care is important.</p>

<h3>Choose a long-term or permanent caregiver and make it official</h3>
<p>The best way to make sure your pet is cared for permanently should you become seriously ill or die is to make formal arrangements through a will, trust or another official document. It’s not enough thatlong ago your friend verbally promised to take in your animal or even that you’ve decided to leave money to your friend for that purpose.</p>

<h3>Entrust an organization to care for your pet</h3>
<p>Most humane organizations do not have the space or resources to care for your companion animal indefinitely and cannot guarantee that someone will adopt your animal. There are some organizations that may be able to board and care for your pet temporarily until they can be adopted by a new caregiver.</p>

<p>For a fee or donation, there are a few organizations that specialize in long-term care of pets of deceased owners and will find your pet a new home or care for your pet for the rest of their life. Before making any formal arrangements, visit the organization you have in mind to see how animals are cared for and what policies and procedures exist regarding placement with a new family. Also look at their financial records and make sure they will be in business when you need them.  If you decide to entrust the care of your animal to an organization, choose a well-established organization that is successful in finding good homes for pets quickly.</p>

<h3>Set up a trust to help</h3>
<p>When you create a trust for your pet, you set aside money to be used for your pet’s care and you specify a trustee to control the funds.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h1>Hot weather tips</h1>
<p>When the temperature begins to climb in the Southland, don’t forget that your furry friends need some extra assistance to help them stay cool and healthy. Your companion animals are less efficient at cooling themselves than humans. Dogs and cats can only cool their bodies by perspiring from their nose and footpads and by panting. But panting very hot air only accelerates heatstroke. By taking some simple precautions, you can keep your companion animals happy and healthy when the temperature soars.</p>
<p>Do not leave your companion animal alone in the car. Not only is it dangerous, it is now illegal in California . Senate Bill 1806 which became law January 1, 2007, says no animal may be left unattended in a vehicle under conditions that “endanger the health or well-being of an animal due to heat, cold, lack of adequate ventilation, lack of food or water, or other circumstances that could reasonably be expected to cause suffering, disability, or death to the animal.” Companion animal guardians who leave their animals unattended under dangerous conditions could face fines, jail time or both.
Reserve playtime for the cool of the early morning or evening, but never after a meal or when the weather is humid.</p>
<p>When the temperature is very high, don’t let your dog stand on hot asphalt. Paw pads can easily blister and burn. Keep walks during these times to a minimum.</p>
<p>If possible, keep your dog or cat inside during the heat of the day to rest in a cool part of the house. Areas with tile floors are generally the coolest. Provide plenty of fresh water for all of your animals and move companion animal beds to shady areas, both indoors and out.</p>
<p>Be especially sensitive to senior and overweight cats and dogs in hot weather. Short muzzled dogs such as Bulldogs, Mastiffs, Pugs, Boston terriers, Lhasa Apsos and Shih Tzus, as well as those with heart or lung diseases, have more difficulty breathing during hot, humid days and should be kept cool in air-conditioned rooms as much as possible.</p>

<p>Don’t shave your companion animals thinking that it will keep them cooler. Their fur protects them against sunburn and helps prevent overheating. Cats should be brushed often.</p>
<p>When companion animals do go outside, protect against sunburn by rubbing hypo-allergenic sunscreen on sensitive areas like the belly and ear tips. Light colored noses or ears are especially susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer. Do not apply any sunscreen to your companion animal that is not labeled specifically for use on animals.</p>
<p>Be aware of the signs of heat stress in your companion animals which include heavy panting, glazed eyes, rapid pulse, unsteadiness, staggering gait, vomiting or a deep red or purple tongue.</p>
<p>If you do notice signs of heat stress, immediately:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lower your companion animal’s body temperature by moving the animal to the shade and applying cool (not cold) water over its body to gradually lower body temperature.</li> 
    <li>Apply ice packs or cold towels only to a companion animal’s head, neck and chest or have companion animals drink small amounts of cool water or lick ice cubes.</li> 
    <li>This is a medical emergency,take your companion animal to a veterinarian as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>

                        <h1>Household hazards</h1>
<p>Every home contains a variety of everyday items and substances that can be dangerous or even fatal if ingested by pets. You can protect your pets health by becoming aware of the most common health hazards found in many pet-owning households.</p>
<h3>What to do if your pet is poisoned</h3>
<p>Don’t wait! Time is critical for successfully treating accidental poisoning.
Pick up the phone and call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center
(1-888-426-4435; a consultation fee may apply). Be prepared to state your pet’s breed, age, weight and any symptoms. Keep the product container or plant sample with you to assist in identification so the appropriate treatment recommendations can be made.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h1>Deceased animal</h1>
<p>When a beloved family pet dies, people have different feelings about burial, cremation or the process. There are dog/cat cemetery’s, companion animal cremation, or you can bury your loved one yourself and have a private memorial.</p>
<p>You can also bring you animal to one of our shelters and we will take care of the body for you. We do not offer any cremation and are unable to return the ashes to you. The City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Sanitation is responsible for picking up dead animals. L.A. Animal Services does not pick up dead animals. If any animals in the City of Los Angeles have died and need to be collected for sanitary reasons, the Bureau of Sanitation will come to your location and pick the animal up for proper disposal.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Sanitation collects dead animals free of charge, except for horses and cows. (For horses and cows, please check your local yellow pages for a rendering service.) Please call 1-800-773-2489, from Monday through Saturday, between 7:30a.m. and 4:45p.m. For after hours and Sundays, please dial 3-1-1 on your home phone.</p>
<p>To make a request for Dead Animal Collection, you must provide the address or location of the animal and a telephone Number</p>
<p>Collectors may enter the home, garage or backyard to retrieve animals, but will not climb or crawl into tight places. Animal is removed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County Public Heath needs your help to keep track of disease carried by birds and squirrels. If you see a dead bird (except pigeons) or a dead tree squirrel, please follow the instructions of the County.</p>
